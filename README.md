<h1>My preferred Manchester United Starting 11 for the 2022/23 season API</h1>

Hi guys, this API lists out the name and age of my preferred Manchester United player for each position when the user sends the position name

<h3>How It's Made:</h3><hr>
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Nodejs<br><br>

This API has an object of my preferred Manchester United Starting 11. Each player is identified by their position, when a player is selected their name and age is sent as a response.
When the API is triggered with the position being sought after the ternary operator was used (i have been trying to get some practice with it) to check if that is a valid
position in the object. If it exists it is returned to the user in JSON format.

<h3>Optimizations</h3><hr>
Next improvement to this api, i could probably add the substitutes as well and maybe the manager.


<h3>Lessons Learned:</h3><hr>
I was able to play around with the get requests using express and improving my objects use in a real world project.
